# Maxmix
**Maxmix** is an open-source volume mixer that allows you to control the volume of any application running on your Windows PC from an external custom device.  

This repository contains the code for all of the software needed for the system.

## Desktop
The desktop directory contains the desktop application, driver installer and firmware installer which are all written in C# and WPF.

Development is done using [Visual Studio 2019 Communitty Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

The application installer is made with [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/).

## Embedded
The embedded directory contains the firmware for the device which uses an Arduino Nano.
You can use your IDE of choice as long as it compiles for that particular chip.
