## Overview
**Maxmix** is an open-source volume mixer that allows you to control the volume applications from an external custom controller.  
It was originally designed to allow to quickly adjust the volume of a game and an external voice chat application like Discord quckly, but it can do so much more...  
You can find out more about the system in the [project website](https://www.maxmixproject.com).

This repository contains the code for all of the software.

## Desktop
The desktop directory contains the **desktop application**, **driver installer** and **firmware installer** which are all written in C# and WPF.  
Development is done using [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  
The application installer is made with [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/).

## Embedded
The embedded directory contains the **device firmware** which uses an Arduino Nano.  
You can use your IDE of choice as long as it compiles for that particular chip.
